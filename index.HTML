    <p > Strawberry is 100% the best ice cream flavor of all time. You can be a little 6 year old kid or a 60 year old senior and still enjoy this flavor. Not only it
        is not super sweet, but in a way it's healthier than any other choices. It's super freshing, and bonus, it's s also pink! </p>

    <p > I shouldn't even need to explain why lemon is on this list! The flavor is zippy, tart, citrus and it's unique  because 
        itâ€™s made with lots of fresh lemon juice. It is also super simple to make even at home. Even if you don't like
    lemon fruit it's self, trust me, the lemon tastes way better! </p>
